# FastText Spam Detection Notebook

Welcome to the FastText Spam Detection Notebook! This repository contains a Python notebook that implements a spam detection algorithm using FastText. With this notebook, you can easily classify messages as spam or not spam.

## Features:
- Utilizes FastText for efficient text classification
- Implements a simple yet powerful approach to spam detection
- Easy-to-understand code with detailed explanations

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook `FastText_Spam_Detection.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells.
4. Input your message in the designated cell to determine if it's spam or not.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- [FastText library: English](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html)
- Required libraries (specified in the notebook)

## Dataset:
The notebook utilizes a dataset of labeled messages, where each message is tagged as spam or not spam. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
